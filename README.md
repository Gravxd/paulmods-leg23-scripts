# Vehicle Interact (Toggle Evidence) - Paul Modification's 2023 Legacy Mega Pack

This script was designed to add an easy rp friendly way for LEO in my server to interact with the cars from this pack that have a pre-designed extra to show evidence on the hood of the vehicle.

I am not endorsing or being sponsored, nor is this an AD for Paul Mods, simply a script i made after purchasing his pack.
You will require it for this script to work, you can [get it here](https://www.paulmodifications.com/2023-legacy-pack)

### Configuration/Installation
If you have the pack in your server, all you need to do is download this resource and put the spawncodes of the vehicles in the `client.lua` at the top line.
